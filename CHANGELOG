Yo, since we're working 12 hours apart and our workflow doesn't use any git commit messages, I figured this would be a helpful record.

Just read this, then add your own to the bottom when you make changes.

/***Bharath 3/12***/
THINGS I DID
Added in more sections (schedule, tab policy, pairings, etc.) and included information on them
Floated columns for schedule


/***Andrew 3/13 ***/
THINGS I DID
Changed the schedule to look a little better, and also to use Bootstrap stuff to be mobile friendly.
Made it two circle buttons up top for contact and schedule
Moved schedule above food (more important)
**Made it so the file that our grayscale.less builds to is the one used by index.html
Put food in with schedule.
Used tables for a bunch of stuff which lookes neater.
Also changed the font stack. Everything is in Lato, a Google Font. I brought in these weights:
    300, which is narrow, for headings
    500, normal, for most things
    900, a heavier bold
    
/***Bharath 3/14 ***/
THINGS I DID
Added in PDFs for the tab policy and tournament info
Changed the content of the contact section slightly to remove emails in plaintext

/***Bharath and Andrew 3/15 ***/
Did a bunch of stuff. Should update later

/***Bharath 3/19 ***/
Updated phone numbers

SUGGESTIONS
We should move all the pairings/motions to a diff page. I started it off with an empty page
The idea is basic tournament info on page one, then all the technical stuff in a slightly less sexy (but more straightforward) other page
This will clean up desing, make both easier to access, and also make it so all the js we'll need doesn't slow down the home page.

THINGS TO DO:
Work on MIT tab functionality
Work on motions functionality
Work on housing functionality
